                <p>
                    Water potability refers to the suitability of water for drinking and cooking, meaning it is safe for 
                    human consumption. This involves meeting certain standards set by health and environmental authorities,
                     which ensure the water is free from harmful contaminants like bacteria, viruses, chemicals, and physical 
                     impurities. Ensuring potable water is a critical public health priority as contaminated water can lead to 
                     severe diseases and health conditions.

                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p>
                    &emsp;Providing potable water to communities can be challenging due to factors such as water pollution, 
                    inadequate infrastructure, and limited resources. These challenges can lead to waterborne diseases, 
                    malnutrition, and other health issues.Nearly 800 million people still lack regular access to clean water.
                     Continued developments in water treatment, both large and small scale, can alleviate unsafe conditions, 
                     fulfilling one of our most basic human needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &emsp;There are many solutions to address the issue of water potability, but they all have a problem. 
                    While chlorine is effective in destroying living organisms in water, its use is regulated due to 
                    potentially harmful byproducts. Imbalances in chlorine can lead to chemical reactions, such as the 
                    formation of trihalomethanes, which could cause pipe corrosion and release iron, copper, and lead 
                    into drinking water. Contamination from leaching, chemical spills, and runoffs has been linked to 
                    long-term health effects like cancer, cardiovascular and neurological diseases, and miscarriage. 
                    Analyzing the exact risks of chemically contaminated water is challenging. Despite disinfectants 
                    making us safer by removing pathogens, the full impact of the chemical cocktail in our drinking
                     water is not fully understood.

                <p>
                    Various solutions exist to address the issue of water potability, including water treatment methods,
                     infrastructure development, and community education. These solutions can improve access to safe 
                     drinking water and ultimately contribute to better health and quality of life.
